  TODO convert views to HAML
  TODO add story status: TODO, IN PROGRESS, TO VERIFY, DONE
    DONE work on a story sets it to IN PROGRESS
    DONE add story to project sets it to TODO
    TODO add work to story should set story to TO VERIFY when remaining is 0
    TODO add parser entry to set story to DONE (or maybe, to set all stories of previous iteration to DONE)
  TODO add support to multi-iteration stories (story.iterations instead of story.iteration)

I decided to keep the project.stories association. We'll handle it this way:
  - project.stories will return all the stories associated to the project, even the ones currently in the backlog but not scheduled for any iteration
  - project.planned_stories will return the stories of this project that were planned for any iteration
